# TODO for Gallery Page Updates

- [x] Generate resized images (small, medium, large) for gallery pictures
- [x] Update gallery.html to use responsive images with srcset and sizes
- [x] Update script.js to restore loading screen (wait for images to load)
- [x] Check and add @keyframes spin in style.css if missing
- [x] Test the gallery page loading and responsiveness
