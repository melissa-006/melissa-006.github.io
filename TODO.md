# TODO for Banner and Nav Layout Fixes

- [x] Fix banner text animation by wrapping text in <span> in index.html to apply CSS animation
- [x] Verify banner uses 'Gasoek One' font and proper size (no changes needed if already set)
- [x] Ensure banner moves horizontally as intended (animation should work after span wrap)
- [x] Confirm nav buttons (image grid) are in strict 3x2 layout on desktop, with responsive fallbacks
- [x] Test banner animation and grid layout visually
